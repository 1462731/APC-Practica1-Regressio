# What is this?
This repository has been made throughout the resolution of the first practicum of the Aprenentatge Computacional class from the Grau d'Enginyeria informàtica at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

The objective of this project is to analyse and predict, using linear regression and gradient descent, one of the attributes of a random dataset given to us. In our case, the assigned dataset is the Tabriz Air Pollution DataSet made by user MalekzaseH. You can find it's Kaggle page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sabermalek/tapds)

# Dataset
The Kaggle website for the dataset provides little to none information on the dataset, but we've determined that the Rahan.csv is to be discarded from the study due to the uncertanty over it's correctness regarding data values and the real-world relation with the data from the other 3 csv documents. Which we've been able to pinpoint to all being different spots in the city of Tabriz, capital of East Azerbaijan, in Iran.

As the dataset name indicates, this data was collected in order to determine air pollution, so our goal has been to build models that can predict that using this dataset.
